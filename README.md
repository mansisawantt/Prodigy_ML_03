# Dogs vs Cats Classification using Deep Learning

## Project Aim

This project aims to classify images of **dogs** and **cats** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. The model is trained on labeled images and optimized for accurate pet classification.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle:  
[Dogs vs Cats Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data)

## Installation

To set up the environment, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn opencv-python
```

## Usage

1. **Load the Dataset**:
   - Extract the dataset and place it in the working directory.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Resize images to a uniform shape.
   - Normalize pixel values for better model performance.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Use a CNN architecture with Conv2D, MaxPooling, and Dense layers.
   - Train on the dataset with augmentation for better generalization.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Assess model accuracy and visualize predictions.

### Example Usage

```python
# Importing necessary libraries
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense, Dropout
```

Ensure the dataset files are correctly structured before running the training script.

## Model Training

- **Architecture**: CNN with multiple convolutional and dense layers.
- **Activation Functions**: ReLU for hidden layers, Softmax/Sigmoid for output.
- **Optimizer**: Adam optimizer for efficient training.
- **Loss Function**: Binary Crossentropy for classification.
- **Performance Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, and Recall.

## Results

Key findings from the model training:
- **Classification Accuracy**: The trained CNN achieves high accuracy in distinguishing dogs from cats.
- **Data Augmentation**: Improves model robustness to variations in images.
- **Visualization**: Displaying misclassified images helps in model improvement.
